Upon loading the game, you must choose a region as a “capital city” (sea regions are not valid). The computer will also select their “capital city”. 
If at any point in the game a capital city falls, the owner of the capital city loses, and the game will terminate. 

You will also be asked to select 1 adjacent region to control (sea regions are valid) in addition to your capital city, for a total of 2 regions. 
Players will also receive a random amount of “economic points”, which are 4 randomly generated numbers from 1 to 4. 
You may purchase units during their turn at the cost of points. Purchased units are automatically placed in reserve. 

Each player has 16 infantry units, 6 tanks, 2 air units, and 5 naval units. All land units (everything except naval) will be placed at the capital. 
The 5 naval units are placed in reserve.
Each region has a predefined number of units. Upon selecting an allied region to control, the region's units will be transferred to the allied team.

RESERVE

The reserve contains units that you currently have, but are not in play.
You may place units that are in reserve into play during the "Inspect" turn.
Note that once units are in play, they cannot be taken back into reserve.
Sea units cannot be placed on land, and land units cannot be placed into the sea. However, air units can be placed in both.

INSPECT

During the inspect turn, you can select regions to view the units, alliance, and parent country.
During this turn, control is passed to the "Info" and "Map" windows. Selecting a region on the map will bring up the information on the "Info" window.
To select a new region, you must first select "Select another region" at which point the text "Waiting for select..." will appear in green.
To end the inspect phase, you must select "End Inspect" at which point the text "Inspection turn ended." will appear in red.

MOVE

NOTE: Moving is done by clicking the REGION NAME, not the region.                                                              
You may move up to as many units as you have into a region adjacent to an allied region. 
	If this results in moving to enemy-occupied territory, a battle will ensue. 
	If it results in moving into a neutral region, a diplomatic event will occur. 
	If this results in moving into a sea region, you will either automatically claim the region (if there is no enemy), or fight the enemy. 

Note that the you may only move naval or air units into the sea. If you own a region adjacent to the sea, you may place naval unit(s) in the sea region, 
	resulting in the aforementioned conditions. 

During a battle, you will fight until the region is entirely occupied by a single side. Retreating is not an option. 
Each unit that the player has will have the opportunity to roll one die, with the exception being that for every tank they have in the region, 
	2 dice are rolled instead of 1. 
Each die has 6 sides. 2 sides are infantry, 1 side is a tank, 1 side is an air unit, and 2 sides are naval units. 
One of the opponents units is eliminated for every die face match. 

During diplomatic relations, you will negotiate with the neutral territory for a peaceful takeover, or a forceful takeover. 
You may negotiate by trading economic points with the region, and the region will either accept or reject their offer. 

When the region accepts the offer, its status will change to 'allied'. 
You will additionally receive a random number of economic points.
Units that are in the neutral region will be transferred to the allied team.

Rejecting the offer will allow the player to make another offer.
If the region rejects the better offer, the player will have to forcefully take over the region. 
A forceful takeover of a neutral region will have the same battle conditions as enemy territory.
Forceful takeovers will result in a lesser chance of other regions to accept future offers.

  There should be 2 values in this file.
  First is a boolean true/false value that specifies if you want to see these instructions.
  	Set this to true if you want to see instruction.
  	Set this to false if you never want to see the instructions.

  Second is a string value with valid values of "action", "ambient", or "none"
  	Set this to "action" (without quotes) if you want to listen to the action music.
	Set this to "ambient" (without quotes) if you want to listen to the ambient music.
	Set this to "none" (without quotes) if you do not wish to have music.
